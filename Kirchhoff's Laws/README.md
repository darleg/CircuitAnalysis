# Kirchhoff's Laws
Kirchhoff's Laws are fundamental principles used in electrical circuit analysis. 
They consist of two main laws: Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and 
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL).

Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):
- Statement: The sum of all currents entering a node (or junction) in a circuit 
  is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node. Essentially, it means that 
  the total current flowing into a node is zero.
- Equation: $$\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$$
- Application: Used to analyze the current distribution in complex circuits. For example, 
  at a node with three branches, if the currents entering are $𝐼_{1}$ and $𝐼_{2}$, and the
  current leaving is $𝐼_{3}$, then $𝐼_{1}+𝐼_{2}=𝐼_{3}$.
  
Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):
- Statement: The sum of all voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is zero. This means 
  that the total energy gained by charges per loop is equal to the energy lost.
- Equation: $$\sum V = 0$$
- Application: Used to determine the voltage drops across components in a loop. For 
  example, in a loop with a voltage source $𝑉$ and resistors $𝑅_{1}$ and $𝑅_{2}$
  with currents $𝐼_{1}$ and $𝐼_{2}$, the equation might look like
  $𝑉−𝐼_{1}𝑅_{1}−𝐼_{2}𝑅_{2}=0$.

Together, these laws help engineers and technicians understand and predict the behavior of electrical circuits. They are the foundation for more advanced circuit analysis techniques like nodal analysis and mesh analysis.
