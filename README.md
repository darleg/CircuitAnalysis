# Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis involves determining the voltages and currents in each component of an electrical circuit.

Here are some fundamental techniques and concepts used in circuit analysis:

Techniques and Concepts
1. Ohm's Law:

$$
  \large V=IR
$$
   
3. Kirchhoff's Laws:

- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL): The sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

$$
\large\sum V=0
$$

- Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL): The sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node.

$$
\large \sum I = 0
$$

3. Thevenin's Theorem: Any linear electrical network with voltage sources and resistances can be replaced by an equivalent single voltage 
   source and a single series resistance.

4. Norton's Theorem: Similar to Thevenin's Theorem, any linear electrical network can be replaced by an equivalent current source in 
   parallel with a single resistance.

5. Superposition Theorem: In a linear circuit with multiple independent sources, the voltage/current for any component is the sum of the 
   voltages/currents produced by each source independently.
