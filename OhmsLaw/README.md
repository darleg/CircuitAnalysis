# Ohm's law
Ohm's Law is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering and physics that describes the relationship between voltage (𝑉), current (𝐼), and resistance (𝑅). It states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance. The mathematical formula is:

$$𝑉=𝐼⋅𝑅$$

Where:

- 𝑉 is the voltage (in volts, 𝑉)
- 𝐼 is the current (in amperes, 𝐴)
- 𝑅 is the resistance (in ohms, Ω)

In simpler terms, Ohm's Law tells us that if we increase the voltage, the current will increase, provided the resistance remains constant. Conversely, if we increase the resistance while keeping the voltage constant, the current will decrease.
